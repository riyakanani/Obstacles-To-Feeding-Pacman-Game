# Obstacles-To-Feeding-Pacman-Game


<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
A Pacman-inspired game with integrated educational questions. The player answers questions by "eating" certain objects in the game. Each correct answer rewards the player with points, and incorrect answers result in a loss of life. Created for global food systems class, specifically for the topic of obstacles to feeding 9.5 Billion. Can run code at: https://editor.p5js.org/rkanani/sketches/yID6DDAOOB

<h2>My Contributions:</h2>

<h3>Game Design:</h3>
I implemented the core mechanics of the Pac-Man game, including character movement, ghost behaviors, and collision detection using p5.js.

<h3>Game Modes:</h3>
I created different game modes such as a welcome screen, gameplay, question mode for answering educational prompts, and an end screen that displays the player's score and game-over message.

<h3>User Interface:</h3>
I designed the UI components to display the score, lives, and educational questions, enhancing the user experience during gameplay.

<h3>Animation and Interaction:</h3>
I used p5.js' built-in functions to animate characters, trigger events upon interactions (such as eating objects and encountering ghosts), and implement the gameâ€™s dynamic elements, like the random movements of the ghosts.
